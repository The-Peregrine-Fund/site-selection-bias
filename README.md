# Site Selection Bias
Appendices and supplementary materials for:
McClure and Rolek. 2023. Pitfalls arising from site selection bias in population monitoring defy simple heuristics. Methods in Ecology and Evolution.

The file Appendix 1.r includes R code for a stochastic simulation model implemented using the simMHB() function in the IPMBook package (Schaub et al., 2022).

The file Appendix 2.nlogo includes code for the modified the SITES simulation model presented by McClure et al. (Appendix 2; 2017). This individual based model was implemented in NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999).
